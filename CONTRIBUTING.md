## Issue tracking

If you have questions, suggestions or have found a bug, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/kroshu/kuka_robot_descriptions/issues).
When filing an issue, please check open issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported it. Please try to include as much information as you can, including:

- The version/commit hash of our code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

Please do not add labels to the issue, that should be handled by the maintainers.

## Contributing

**The urdf/xacro files are automatically generated, therefore we do not accept any pull requests, that add new robot models.** If you'd like us to add a new robot model, please open a *GitHub issue* and specify the model you'd like to see included.

Other contributions are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please:

- Discuss the proposed changes with the maintainers, preferably in an issue
- Fork the repository
- Modify the source focusing on the specific change you are contributing
- Ensure that local tests pass (`colcon test` and `pre-commit` run)
- Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation

When creating a pull request, please ensure that:

- Your PR addresses only one issue
- Your PR has a descriptive title and a short summary
- All pipelines are green, including
  - Industrial CI
  - Spell checks
  - Linters
